```
Login as TEACHER → Try to access:
http://localhost:3001/dashboard/payments

Expected: 403 Forbidden or redirect
```

### Test 2: API Direct Call
```bash
# Login as teacher, copy session cookie, then:
curl -H "Cookie: next-auth.session-token=..." \
  http://localhost:3001/api/payments

Expected: {"error":"Forbidden"}
```

### Test 3: Data Isolation
```
