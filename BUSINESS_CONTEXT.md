## Business Targets & KPIs

| Lead Conversion Rate | >25% | <15% needs attention |

| Payment Collection | <5% overdue | >15% overdue is critical |
| Trial Attendance | >70% | <50% means wasted leads |

## Revenue Patterns
- **Peak Season**: January, September (new year resolutions, post-summer)

## Team Structure
- **Founder**: Strategy, marketing oversight, key decisions
- **Teachers**: Contractors paid hourly (tracked in teacher-hours)
- **Marketing Team**: Lead management, outreach calls, follow-ups

## Common Business Challenges
1. **Student Dropout**: Usually due to low attendance or payment issues
2. **Lead Quality**: Meta Ads volume vs. conversion quality tradeoff
3. **Batch Scheduling**: Balancing morning/evening demand
4. **Teacher Availability**: Matching teacher hours to batch needs
5. **Payment Delays**: Following up on overdue payments

## What Good Analysis Looks Like
When analyzing data, prioritize:
1. **Urgent Issues First**: High churn risk students, payment overdues, empty batches
2. **Trends Over Snapshots**: Compare to previous period, not just current state
3. **Actionable Insights**: Every observation should have a recommended action
4. **Specific Numbers**: "12 students at risk" not "some students might churn"
5. **Root Cause Focus**: Why is attendance dropping, not just that it dropped

## Seasonal Context
- **December-January**: Holiday slowdown, then New Year enrollment spike
- **March-April**: Indian exam season, lower engagement
- **September**: Major enrollment push (German university intake alignment)
- **Weekends**: No classes; use for catch-up and review sessions

## Communication Style
- Be direct and data-driven
- Flag problems early with severity (critical/warning/info)
- Suggest specific actions, not generic advice
- Reference targets when discussing performance
- Acknowledge wins, but focus on actionable improvements
