---

## 2. API Route Integration Audit

### Critical Issues Found:

#### 🔴 CRITICAL #1: Missing Batch Email Notification
**Location:** `app/api/batches/[id]/route.ts`
**Issue:** When batch is updated or student assigned, no email sent
**Expected:** Should trigger `batch-start` email when:
- Student assigned to batch
- Batch startDate is set/changed
- Batch status changes to RUNNING

**Impact:** Students don't get notified about batch assignments
**Fix Required:** Add email trigger in batch update logic

#### 🔴 CRITICAL #2: Referral Email Preference Not Checked
**Location:** `app/api/referrals/[id]/route.ts:93-107`
**Issue:** Code checks `referral.referrer.emailNotifications` and `referral.referrer.emailReferral` but referrer is included with only basic fields:
```typescript
include: {
  referrer: true,  // This doesn't include email preferences!
  referee: true,
}
```
**Impact:** Email preference check will fail, emails won't be sent
**Fix Required:** Include email preferences in query

#### 🔴 CRITICAL #3: Cron Jobs Don't Check Email Preferences
**Locations:**
- `app/api/cron/payment-reminders/route.ts`
- `app/api/cron/attendance-alerts/route.ts`
- `app/api/cron/month-completion/route.ts`

**Issue:** Cron jobs send emails without checking student email preferences
**Impact:** Students receive emails even if they opted out
**Fix Required:** Add preference checks before sending

### High Priority Issues:

#### 🟠 HIGH #1: Missing Churn Risk Calculation
**Location:** Student module
**Issue:** `churnRisk` field exists but never calculated/updated
**Expected:** Should be calculated based on:
- Attendance rate < 50% = HIGH
- Attendance 50-75% AND payment overdue = MEDIUM
- Otherwise = LOW

**Impact:** Churn risk alerts don't work
**Fix Required:** Add churn risk calculation in attendance/payment updates

#### 🟠 HIGH #2: Month Completion Not Updating Referral
**Location:** `app/api/cron/month-completion/route.ts:60-76`
**Issue:** Logic finds referrals and updates them, BUT only for students enrolled exactly 30 days ago
**Problem:** If cron job misses a day, those referrals never get marked complete
**Fix Required:** Check for students enrolled ≥30 days ago (not exactly 30)

#### 🟠 HIGH #3: No Batch Capacity Enforcement
**Location:** `app/api/students/route.ts` (student creation/update)
**Issue:** Students can be assigned to batches even when full
**Expected:** Should check batch capacity before assignment
**Impact:** Batches can exceed totalSeats
**Fix Required:** Add capacity check before batch assignment

#### 🟠 HIGH #4: Payment Status Overdue Logic Issue
**Location:** `app/api/payments/route.ts:145-162`
**Issue:** Overdue calculation runs on every payment, but checks 30 days from enrollment
**Problem:**
```typescript
const daysSinceEnrollment = Math.floor(...)
if (balance > 0 && daysSinceEnrollment > 30) {
  paymentStatus = "OVERDUE"
}
```
This overwrites PARTIAL status immediately after 30 days, even if student is paying regularly

**Fix Required:** Check last payment date, not enrollment date

#### 🟠 HIGH #5: Batch Financial Stats Not Auto-Updated
**Location:** `app/api/batches/[id]/route.ts:37-41`
**Issue:** Financial stats calculated on GET but not saved
**Impact:**
- `revenueActual` and `profit` fields in DB never updated
- Reports/analytics based on DB values will be wrong

**Fix Required:** Update batch financials when students enrolled/payments made

### Medium Priority Issues:

#### 🟡 MEDIUM #1: Attendance "LATE" Not Counted as Present
**Location:** `app/api/attendance/route.ts:175-177`
**Issue:**
```typescript
const classesAttended = attendanceRecords.filter(
  (record) => record.status === "PRESENT"
).length
```
Students marked "LATE" don't count as attended

**Fix Required:** Count both PRESENT and LATE as attended

#### 🟡 MEDIUM #2: No Duplicate Referral Check Before Update
**Location:** `app/api/referrals/[id]/route.ts`
**Issue:** Creating referrals checks duplicates, but updating doesn't
**Risk:** Could update referral to create duplicate referrer-referee pair
**Fix Required:** Add duplicate check on UPDATE

#### 🟡 MEDIUM #3: Missing Error Handling for Email Failures
**Location:** All email sending locations
**Issue:** `await sendEmail()` can throw errors, no try-catch
**Impact:** Failed email could crash payment/enrollment flow
**Fix Required:** Wrap email sends in try-catch, log but don't fail

#### 🟡 MEDIUM #4: No Transaction Rollback on Partial Failures
**Location:** `app/api/attendance/route.ts:95-116` (bulk attendance)
**Issue:** If one student update fails, previous ones already committed
**Fix:** Already using `$transaction` ✅ but student updates are outside it ❌
**Fix Required:** Move student updates inside transaction

- ✅ payment-reminder
- ✅ batch-start
- ✅ attendance-alert
- ✅ referral-payout
- ✅ month-complete

### Preference Checks:

| Module | Location | Status | Issue |
|--------|----------|--------|-------|
| Student Welcome | `app/api/students/route.ts:124` | ✅ GOOD | Checks both flags |
| Payment Received | `app/api/payments/route.ts:130-134` | ✅ GOOD | Checks both flags |
| Referral Payout | `app/api/referrals/[id]/route.ts:93-97` | ❌ BROKEN | Preferences not loaded |
| Payment Reminder | `app/api/cron/payment-reminders/route.ts:36` | ❌ MISSING | No check |
| Attendance Alert | `app/api/cron/attendance-alerts/route.ts:36` | ❌ MISSING | No check |
| Month Complete | `app/api/cron/month-completion/route.ts:54` | ❌ MISSING | No check |
| Batch Start | N/A | ❌ MISSING | Not implemented |

**Overall Email Integration:** ⚠️ 50% COMPLETE

## 6. Type Safety & Null Handling Audit

### Null Handling Issues:

#### Issue 1: Optional Batch Assignment
**Location:** Multiple student queries
**Pattern:**
```typescript
student.batch?.batchCode  // ✅ GOOD - safe navigation
```
**Status:** ✅ PROPERLY HANDLED

#### Issue 2: Optional Email Field
**Location:** All email sending
**Pattern:**
```typescript
if (student.email && preferences) {  // ✅ GOOD
  await sendEmail(...)
}
```
**Status:** ✅ PROPERLY HANDLED

#### Issue 3: Optional Transaction ID
**Location:** Payment email
**Pattern:**
```typescript
transactionId: payment.transactionId  // Could be null
```
**Status:** ✅ HANDLED (template shows "N/A" if null)

#### Issue 4: Date Formatting
**Location:** Multiple email templates
**Pattern:**
```typescript
paymentDate.toLocaleDateString()  // Could fail if undefined
```
**Status:** ✅ SAFE (paymentDate defaults to now())

### TypeScript Issues:

#### Issue 1: Any Types in Queries
**Location:** All API routes
**Pattern:**
```typescript
const where: any = {}  // ⚠️ LOOSE TYPING
```
**Impact:** Type safety lost for query building
**Severity:** Low (Prisma validates at runtime)

#### Issue 2: Implicit Casting
**Location:** Financial calculations
**Pattern:**
```typescript
Number(student.balance)  // Could be NaN if invalid
```
**Status:** ⚠️ RISKY but Decimal type prevents invalid data

---

## 7. Performance & Scalability Audit

### Database Queries:

#### ✅ GOOD: Proper Indexing
- All foreign keys indexed
- Common filter fields indexed (status, date, etc.)
- Unique constraints on business keys

#### ⚠️ CONCERN: N+1 Queries Potential
**Location:** Dashboard analytics
**Issue:** Fetches all students with includes, could be slow at scale
**Recommendation:** Add pagination/limits for production

#### ⚠️ CONCERN: Transaction Efficiency
**Location:** Bulk attendance
**Current:** Updates students sequentially after transaction
**Better:** Include student updates in transaction

### Email Performance:

#### Current: Sequential Sending
```typescript
for (const student of students) {
  await sendEmail(...)  // ⚠️ Blocks
}
```

#### Recommendation: Batch Processing
```typescript
await Promise.allSettled(
  students.map(s => sendEmail(...))
)
```

## 8. Security Audit

### Authentication: ✅ SECURE
- All routes check session ✅
- Proper role-based access ✅
- JWT tokens used ✅

### Authorization: ✅ ADEQUATE
- Cron jobs require secret ✅
- No student data exposed to public ✅

### Data Validation: ⚠️ PARTIAL
- ✅ Prisma validates types
- ❌ No input sanitization
- ❌ No rate limiting

### Sensitive Data: ✅ PROTECTED
- Passwords hashed ✅
- Email credentials in env ✅
- No PII in logs ✅

---
