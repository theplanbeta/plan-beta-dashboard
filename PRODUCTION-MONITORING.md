## üìù Audit Logging System

### Database Schema

All audit logs are stored in the `AuditLog` table with the following information:

```prisma
model AuditLog {
  action        AuditAction       // What happened
  severity      AuditSeverity     // INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
  description   String            // Human-readable description

  // Who performed the action
  userId        String?
  userEmail     String?
  userName      String?
  ipAddress     String?
  userAgent     String?

  // What was affected
  entityType    String?           // "Lead", "Invoice", "Student", etc.
  entityId      String?

  // Additional context
  metadata      Json?             // Before/after values, transaction details

  // Error tracking
  errorMessage  String?
  errorStack    String?

  // Timestamps
  createdAt     DateTime
}
```

### Using Audit Logs

**In API endpoints:**

```typescript
import { logSuccess, logError, logCritical } from '@/lib/audit'
import { AuditAction } from '@prisma/client'

// Log successful action
await logSuccess(
  AuditAction.INVOICE_GENERATED,
  `Invoice ${invoiceNumber} generated for ${studentName}`,
  {
    entityType: 'Invoice',
    entityId: invoice.id,
    metadata: {
      amount: totalAmount,
      currency: 'EUR',
    },
    request: req, // Captures IP, user agent, etc.
  }
)

// Log error
await logError(
  AuditAction.API_ERROR,
  `Failed to process payment`,
  error,
  {
    entityType: 'Payment',
    entityId: paymentId,
    request: req,
  }
)

// Log critical error (high-value transaction failure)
await logCritical(
  AuditAction.LEAD_TO_STUDENT_CONVERSION,
  `CRITICAL: Conversion failed mid-transaction`,
  error,
  {
    entityType: 'Lead',
    entityId: leadId,
    metadata: { paidAmount, invoiceNumber },
    request: req,
  }
)
```

## üîç Error Tracking (Sentry)

### Setup

1. **Get Sentry DSN** from sentry.io
2. **Add to `.env.local`:**

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=https://your-dsn@sentry.io/project-id
```

3. **Sentry is automatically configured** in:
   - `sentry.client.config.ts` - Frontend errors
   - `sentry.server.config.ts` - Backend errors

### Features

‚úÖ **Automatic Error Capture** - All uncaught errors sent to Sentry
‚úÖ **Source Maps** - See exact line of code that failed
‚úÖ **User Context** - Know which user experienced the error
‚úÖ **Session Replay** - Watch what user did before error
‚úÖ **Performance Monitoring** - Track slow API calls

### Error Filtering

Sentry is configured to:
- ‚ùå **NOT send errors in development** (keeps logs clean)
- ‚úÖ **Filter out cookies** (security)
- ‚úÖ **Mask authorization headers** (security)
- ‚úÖ **Include environment info** (production vs staging)

## ‚ù§Ô∏è System Health Monitoring

### Health Check Endpoint

**URL:** `/api/system/health`

**Response:**

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-06T12:00:00Z",
  "responseTime": "45ms",
  "checks": {
    "database": {
      "status": "healthy",
      "message": "Database connection successful"
    },
    "databasePerformance": {
      "status": "healthy",
      "queryTime": "12ms",
      "threshold": "1000ms"
    },
    "errorRate": {
      "status": "healthy",
      "errorRate": "0.5%",
      "errors": 2,
      "critical": 0,
      "total": 400,
      "period": "last 1 hour"
    },
    "systemMetrics": {
      "status": "healthy",
      "students": 125,
      "leads": 340,
      "invoices": 89,
      "payments": 156
    },
    "recentActivity": {
      "status": "healthy",
      "conversions": 12,
      "payments": 18,
      "period": "last 24 hours"
    }
  }
}
```

### Health Status Levels

- **`healthy`** - All systems operational
- **`degraded`** - System working but with warnings
- **`unhealthy`** - Critical issues detected

### Monitoring Checks

1. **Database Connection** - Can we connect to Postgres?
2. **Query Performance** - Are queries responding in <1s?
3. **Error Rate** - Are we seeing <5% errors?
4. **System Metrics** - Data counts across entities
5. **Recent Activity** - Conversions/payments in last 24h

## üö® Alert Configuration

### Recommended Alerts

**1. Critical Errors**
- Trigger: Any `CRITICAL` severity log
- Action: Immediate email/SMS to founder
- Example: Failed payment or conversion

**2. High Error Rate**
- Trigger: >10% errors in last hour
- Action: Email notification
- Check: `/api/system/health` errorRate

- Trigger: Query time >2 seconds
- Action: Performance investigation
- Check: `/api/system/health` databasePerformance

**4. No Recent Activity**
- Trigger: 0 conversions/payments in 48h
- Action: Check system status
- Check: `/api/system/health` recentActivity

### Integration Options

**Email Alerts:**
- Use audit logs API to fetch recent CRITICAL logs
- Send daily digest of errors to founder

**Slack/Discord:**
- Webhook on CRITICAL errors
- POST to webhook with error details

**Uptime Monitoring:**
- Ping `/api/system/health` every 5 minutes
- Alert if response is not "healthy"

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### How to investigate an error:

1. **Check Activity Dashboard** (`/dashboard/activity`)
   - Filter to "Errors Only"
   - Find the error event
   - Check IP address, user, entity affected

2. **Query Audit Logs via API**

```bash
# Get recent errors
GET /api/system/audit-logs?type=errors&limit=50

# Get stats
GET /api/system/audit-logs?type=stats
```

3. **Check System Health**

```bash
GET /api/system/health
```

4. **Check Sentry Dashboard**
   - Go to sentry.io
   - View error details, stack trace
   - Watch session replay

### Common Issues

**Error: "Audit logging failed"**
- Audit logging errors are logged to console but don't crash the app
- Check database connection
- Review `/lib/audit.ts` error handling

**Activity Dashboard shows no data**
- Check user role (only FOUNDER can access)
- Verify `/api/system/audit-logs` returns data
- Check browser console for errors

**Health check fails**
- Database connection issue
- Check `DATABASE_URL` env variable
- Test Prisma connection: `npx prisma db push`
